# Phase 4.2: Agent Composition Pattern - Complete ✅

## Problem Solved
**Issue**: How to enable Router Agent to coordinate with specialist agents without infinite loops or complex A2A orchestration?

**Solution**: Use Microsoft Agent Framework's native **agent-as-tool pattern** with `.as_tool()`

## Architecture

### Before (Failed Approach)
- A2A protocol with hardcoded `/a2a` endpoint
- All A2A calls routed to same endpoint → infinite loop
- No routing logic between specialist agents
- Complex recursive agent creation

### After (Working Approach)
```
User Query
    ↓
Router Agent (with specialist agents as tools)
    ├── [Tool] sql_agent (SQL Query Agent)
    ├── [Tool] azure_ops (Azure Operations Agent)  
    ├── [Tool] support_triage (Support Triage Agent)
    └── [Tool] data_analytics (Data Analytics Agent)
```

Router Agent can now:
1. Understand user intent
2. Select appropriate specialist agent tool
3. Invoke specialist agent
4. Receive response
5. Format final answer to user

## Implementation

### 1. Removed A2A Tools from Registry
**File**: `backend/src/agents/tool_registry.py`
- Removed A2A tool registration block
- A2A tools no longer registered (not needed)
- Registry now only has: MCP tools + OpenAPI tools + Custom tools

### 2. Created Specialist Agents Loader
**File**: `backend/src/agents/factory.py`
**New Method**: `AgentFactory.load_specialist_agents_as_tools(agent_repo)`

```python
# For each specialist agent (sql-agent, azure-ops, support-triage, data-analytics):
# 1. Load agent from repository
# 2. Create agent instance with its tools
# 3. Convert to tool using agent.agent.as_tool()
# 4. Return list of tools
```

**Key Insight**: Must use `agent.agent.as_tool()` where:
- `agent` = our DemoBaseAgent wrapper
- `agent.agent` = underlying ChatAgent from Agent Framework
- `.as_tool()` = Agent Framework method to convert agent to function tool

### 3. Updated Agent Factory to Load Specialist Tools for Router
**File**: `backend/src/agents/factory.py`
**Modified Method**: `AgentFactory.create_from_metadata()`

Added special handling for Router Agent:
```python
if agent_id == "router":
    # Load specialist agents and convert to tools
    specialist_tools = AgentFactory.load_specialist_agents_as_tools(agent_repo)
    # Extend Router Agent's tools with specialist agent tools
    tools.extend(specialist_tools)
```

### 4. Router Agent Configuration Remains Simple
**File**: `backend/src/persistence/seed_agents.py`

```python
AgentMetadata(
    id="router",
    name="Router Agent",
    tools=[],  # No tools configured in metadata
    # Tools are loaded dynamically at runtime by factory
    system_prompt="You are a helpful agent that can answer questions about various topics..."
)
```

**Note**: `tools=[]` in metadata is correct - tools are added dynamically during agent creation, not stored in Cosmos DB.

## How It Works

### When Router Agent is Created
1. AgentFactory.create_from_metadata("router") called
2. Loads metadata from Cosmos DB (tools=[])
3. Detects it's the Router Agent
4. Calls load_specialist_agents_as_tools()
5. For each specialist agent:
   - Creates agent instance
   - Calls `.as_tool()` on underlying ChatAgent
   - Returns AIFunction tool
6. Adds 4 specialist agent tools to Router Agent
7. Router Agent initialized with all 4 tools

### When User Asks Router Agent a Question
1. Router Agent receives: "What tables are available in the database?"
2. Router Agent decides: "This is a SQL query question → use sql_agent tool"
3. Router Agent calls: `sql_agent(query="SELECT * FROM sys.tables...")`
4. SQL Agent executes query with its own tools (MCP MSSQL tool)
5. SQL Agent returns: "Found tables: Customers, Orders, Products..."
6. Router Agent formats: "Based on the SQL Agent, here are the available tables..."
7. Returns response to user

## Testing Results

### Test Query
```
User: "What tables are available in the database?"
```

### Backend Logs Show

[SPECIALIST_TOOLS] ✓ Converted to tool: sql-agent
[SPECIALIST_TOOLS] ✓ Converted to tool: azure-ops

[FACTORY] Adding 4 specialist agent tools to Router Agent
[AGENT_INIT] Initializing DemoBaseAgent:
  - name: Router Agent
  - model: gpt-4o
  - tools provided: 4
    [0] AIFunction: AIFunction(name=sql_agent, ...)
    [1] AIFunction: AIFunction(name=azure_ops, ...)
    [2] AIFunction: AIFunction(name=support_triage, ...)
    [3] AIFunction: AIFunction(name=data_analytics, ...)
```

### Agent Interaction
```
Tool call request found: {
  "name": "sql_agent",
  "arguments": "{\"query\":\"SHOW TABLES;\"}"
}
```

✅ **Router Agent successfully calls sql_agent tool!**

The response "It seems there was an issue accessing the database..." is the SQL Agent's response - not an error in routing. The SQL Agent executed and returned that result (SHOW TABLES is not valid MSSQL syntax, but that's a separate detail).

## Key Benefits

1. **No Infinite Loops**: Each specialist agent is distinct, controlled invocation
2. **Clean Architecture**: Uses Agent Framework's native composition pattern
3. **Easy to Debug**: Clear tool call logs showing which agent is being used
4. **Scalable**: Can add more specialist agents easily
5. **Native Support**: Agent Framework's `.as_tool()` handles all complexity
6. **Type Safe**: AIFunction tools are properly recognized by LLM
7. **Bidirectional**: Router can call specialists, specialists can use their own tools

## Related Files Changed

- `backend/src/agents/tool_registry.py`: Removed A2A tool registration
- `backend/src/agents/factory.py`: Added specialist agent loader and Router Agent special handling
- `backend/src/persistence/seed_agents.py`: Updated seed function to handle Router Agent updates

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test Router Agent calls specialist agents
2. ⏳ Test different query types to verify each specialist is called correctly:
   - Database queries → SQL Agent
   - Azure infrastructure → Azure Ops Agent
   - Support issues → Support Triage Agent
   - Analytics/reports → Data Analytics Agent
3. ⏳ Fine-tune Router Agent's system prompt to better guide tool selection
4. ⏳ Add confidence/reasoning to tool selection decisions
5. ⏳ Monitor tool call patterns to optimize specialist agent descriptions
