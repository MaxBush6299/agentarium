# Multi-Agent Router Implementation (Phase 4.0)

**Status:** ✅ ROUTER AGENT CREATED & CONFIGURED  
**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## 📋 Overview

Implemented a **general-purpose Router Agent** that acts as an intelligent dispatcher, delegating user requests to specialized agents via the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol.

**Key Innovation:** Instead of hard-coded support routing, the Router understands any type of user query and intelligently routes to:
- **SQL Agent** - Database & data queries
- **Azure Ops Agent** - Infrastructure & deployment questions
- **Support Triage Agent** - Documentation & troubleshooting
- **Data Analytics Agent** - Business intelligence & reporting

---

## 🎯 Agent Configuration

### Router Agent Metadata

```
ID: router
Name: Router Agent
Status: ACTIVE
Model: gpt-4o
Temperature: 0.7
Max Tokens: 4000
Max Messages: 25
```

### Routing Logic (System Prompt)

The Router Agent's system prompt includes explicit routing rules:

**Specialist Agents Available:**
1. **SQL Agent** → Data queries, sales reports, customer analysis
2. **Azure Ops Agent** → Infrastructure, deployments, monitoring
3. **Support Triage Agent** → Documentation, troubleshooting, help
4. **Data Analytics Agent** → Business intelligence, trends, dashboards

**Routing Decision Tree:**
```
User Query
├─ "Show me sales data"? → SQL Agent
├─ "Check my Azure resources"? → Azure Ops Agent
├─ "How do I...?" / "Help with..." → Support Triage Agent
├─ "Create a dashboard" / "Analyze trends"? → Data Analytics Agent
└─ Multiple aspects? → Call multiple agents in sequence
```

## 🔧 A2A Tool Configuration

The Router Agent has 4 A2A tools configured, one for each specialist:

```python
# A2A Tool for SQL Agent
ToolConfig(
    type=ToolType.A2A,
    name="sql-agent",
    a2a_agent_id="sql-agent",
    config={"description": "SQL Query Agent for database operations"},
    enabled=True
)

# A2A Tool for Azure Ops Agent
ToolConfig(
    type=ToolType.A2A,
    name="azure-ops",
    a2a_agent_id="azure-ops",
    config={"description": "Azure Operations Agent"},
    enabled=True
)

# A2A Tool for Support Triage Agent
ToolConfig(
    type=ToolType.A2A,
    name="support-triage",
    a2a_agent_id="support-triage",
    config={"description": "Support Triage Agent"},
    enabled=True
)

# A2A Tool for Data Analytics Agent
ToolConfig(
    type=ToolType.A2A,
    name="data-analytics",
    a2a_agent_id="data-analytics",
    config={"description": "Data Analytics Agent"},
    enabled=True
)
```

**Tool Type:** `ToolType.A2A` (Agent-to-Agent via A2A Protocol)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Communication Flow

```
┌─────────────┐
│   User      │
└──────┬──────┘
       │ (Query: "Show me Q4 sales and create a dashboard")
       ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Router Agent                               │
│  - Understands intent                       │
│  - Plans delegation strategy                │
│  - Routes to appropriate specialists        │
└──────┬──────────────────────────────────────┘
       │
       ├─ A2A Call #1: SQL Agent
       │  │ (Query: "SELECT Q4 sales data")
       │  └─ Result: [Sales data]
       │
       └─ A2A Call #2: Data Analytics Agent
          │ (Input: Sales data + "Create dashboard")
          └─ Result: [Dashboard/Report]
       │
       ▼
   [Aggregated Response to User]
```

### Tool Flow

1. **Router receives user query**
2. **Decides which specialist(s) to call**
3. **Uses A2A Tool** to call specialist agent
4. **Specialist agent runs** (own tools + logic)
5. **Result returned** via A2A protocol
6. **Router aggregates** results if multiple calls
7. **Final response** sent to user

## 📊 Agent Lineup (Updated)

| # | Agent | Status | Type | Purpose |
|---|-------|--------|------|---------|
| 1 | Router | ✅ ACTIVE | Orchestrator | Multi-agent routing |
| 2 | Support Triage | ✅ ACTIVE | Specialist | Support & docs |
| 3 | Azure Ops | ✅ ACTIVE | Specialist | Infrastructure |
| 4 | SQL Agent | ✅ ACTIVE | Specialist | Data queries |
| 5 | Data Analytics | ✅ ACTIVE | Specialist | Business intelligence |
| 6 | Business Impact | ❌ INACTIVE | Specialist | Future: Impact analysis |

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test 1: Router Agent Creation
```bash
Expected: Agent factory successfully creates Router Agent
Verify: Agent has all 4 A2A tools loaded
```

### Test 2: A2A Tool Registry
```bash
Expected: ToolRegistry loads A2A tool type
Verify: A2A tools are registered and callable
```

### Test 3: Single-Agent Routing
```
Query: "Show me the top 10 customers from the database"
Expected: Router → SQL Agent → Results
Verify: Router makes correct A2A call, receives data
```

### Test 4: Multi-Agent Routing
```
Query: "Give me top customer analysis and create a report"
Expected: Router → SQL Agent → Data Analytics Agent → Results
Verify: Multiple A2A calls work in sequence
```

### Test 5: Clarification
```
Query: "I need help"
Expected: Router asks clarifying questions
Verify: Router doesn't route prematurely
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. **Verify A2A tool loading** in ToolRegistry
   - Check that A2A tools are properly registered
   - Verify agent factory loads Router Agent successfully

2. **Test via API**
   - Start backend
   - Call Router Agent endpoint
   - Test with routing queries
   - Verify A2A calls work

### Short Term (Next Session)
1. **Integrate Azure Storage tool** into Data Analytics Agent
2. **Add more routing examples** to system prompt
3. **Handle edge cases** (ambiguous queries, multiple interpretations)
4. **Add telemetry** (track routing decisions, success rates)

### Medium Term
1. **Chain optimization** (minimize sequential calls)
2. **Context passing** (share data between sequential calls)
3. **Error recovery** (what if specialist fails?)
4. **User preferences** (learn routing patterns)

## 📝 Key Design Decisions

### ✅ Why A2A Protocol?
- **Loose coupling** - Agents don't need to know about each other's internals
- **Standardized** - Uses open A2A spec v0.3.0
- **Extensible** - Easy to add new specialist agents
- **Observable** - Each A2A call is logged and traceable

### ✅ Why Temperature 0.7?
- **Balanced** - Not too deterministic, not too creative
- **Reasoning** - Needs to think about routing decisions
- **Prevents hallucination** - But allows natural language understanding
- **Consistent** - Similar to other agent baselines

### ✅ Why Max Messages 25?
- **Sufficient** - Room for clarification + delegation + synthesis
- **Reasonable** - Not too many token costs
- **Default** - Based on support triage agent config
- **Tunable** - Can adjust based on testing

---

## 🔍 Code Changes

### File: `backend/src/persistence/seed_agents.py`

**Changes:**
1. Updated docstring to include Router Agent
2. Added Router Agent as first agent (id: "router")
3. Router has 4 A2A tools (sql-agent, azure-ops, support-triage, data-analytics)
4. Renumbered all subsequent agents

**Lines Modified:** ~80 lines added for Router Agent definition

## 📚 A2A Protocol Reference

### Tool Type
```python
type=ToolType.A2A  # Available in persistence/models.py
```

### Tool Configuration
```python
ToolConfig(
    type=ToolType.A2A,              # A2A protocol
    name="target-agent-name",       # Human-readable name
    a2a_agent_id="agent-id",        # Agent to call (from seed_agents)
    config={...},                   # Optional config
    enabled=True                    # Enable/disable tool
)
```

### Expected Behavior
- Agent factory detects A2A tool type
- ToolRegistry creates A2A callable
- During execution, A2A tool invokes target agent
- Results returned to calling agent
- Entire interaction is logged
