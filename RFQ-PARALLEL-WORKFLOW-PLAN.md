# Parallel RFQ Workflow Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Build a sophisticated multi-agent workflow that automates Request for Quotation (RFQ) processes using parallel orchestration patterns. The system will handle complex vendor evaluation, negotiation, and human oversight for procurement decisions.

**Workflow Pattern**: Parallel branching with merge, sequential handoffs, and human-in-the-loop gates.

  - Responsibilities:
    - âœ… Category-based specification extraction
    - âœ… Automatic certification mapping (16+ categories with specific certs)
    - âœ… Compliance standard determination (RoHS, REACH, HIPAA, FDA, EPA, etc.)

  - Ready for MS Agent Framework integration via factory pattern

---

## LLM Integration Architecture (Phase 3+)

### Design Philosophy
- **Phase 2 (Rule-based)**: ProductReviewAgent, VendorQualificationAgent use deterministic category mappings and SQL lookups
- **Phase 3+ (LLM-enhanced)**: Parallel evaluation agents use Azure OpenAI for nuanced analysis
- **Factory Pattern**: Follows existing codebase pattern from `src/agents/factory.py` and `src/agents/base.py`

### LLM-Enhanced Agents Created (Phase 3 Preparation)

#### 1. CertificationComplianceEvaluator (Track 1)
**File**: `backend/src/agents/workflows/rfq/agents/llm_evaluators.py`

Extends `DemoBaseAgent` with LLM for nuanced compliance analysis:
- **Input**: `ProductRequirements` + `VendorProfile`
- **LLM Role**: Assess QUALITY of compliance (not just existence)
  - Are certifications current and legitimate?
  - Any red flags in compliance history?
  - Geopolitical or regulatory concerns?
- **Output**: JSON with risk_level, recommendation, reasoning
- **System Prompt**: Specialized for compliance analyst role with temperature=0.3 (analytical)
- **Integration**: Inherits from DemoBaseAgent, uses ChatAgent internally

#### 2. FinancialAnalysisEvaluator (Track 3)
**File**: `backend/src/agents/workflows/rfq/agents/llm_evaluators.py`

Extends `DemoBaseAgent` with LLM for financial anomaly detection:
- **Input**: Multiple `VendorProfile` objects + `QuoteResponse` list
- **LLM Role**: Detect pricing patterns and anomalies
  - Why is this vendor 40% cheaper than others?
  - Are volume discounts reasonable or suspicious?
  - What's the best negotiation strategy?
- **Output**: JSON with price_analysis, anomalies, negotiation_strategy, best_value_vendor
- **System Prompt**: Specialized for financial analyst role with temperature=0.4 (analytical + strategic)
- **Integration**: Suggests talking points and trade-off proposals

#### 3. DeliveryRiskAssessor (Track 2 - Lighter LLM)
**File**: `backend/src/agents/workflows/rfq/agents/llm_evaluators.py`

Extends `DemoBaseAgent` with LLM for geopolitical/supply chain risk:
- **Input**: `ProductRequirements` + `VendorProfile`
- **LLM Role**: Flag non-deterministic risks
  - Geopolitical factors by vendor country
  - Supply chain concentration risk
  - Capacity concerns for this order
- **Output**: JSON with geopolitical_risk, supply_chain_risk, lead_time_status
- **Note**: Track 2 is lighter on LLM since delivery times are mostly rule-based

### LLM Agent Factory Pattern
**File**: `backend/src/agents/workflows/rfq/agents/llm_evaluators.py`

Created `LLMEvaluationAgentFactory` following factory pattern from codebase:
```python
# Factory creates LLM-enhanced agents from requirements
compliance_evaluator = LLMEvaluationAgentFactory.create_compliance_evaluator(requirements)
financial_evaluator = LLMEvaluationAgentFactory.create_financial_evaluator(product_name, qty)
delivery_assessor = LLMEvaluationAgentFactory.create_delivery_assessor(requirements)

# Each agent inherits from DemoBaseAgent, has system_prompt and model config
# Each agent has async evaluate/analyze method for framework integration
```

### Why This Hybrid Approach Works

**Keep Rule-Based (Phase 2)**:
- Deterministic: "electronics" â†’ always needs CE/RoHS/UL
- Auditable: Easy to trace why a vendor was qualified/rejected
- Fast: Category lookups, no LLM latency
- Cost-effective: No API calls for preprocessing

**Add LLM (Phase 3)**:
- Nuanced analysis: "This vendor's rating looks good, but compliance history has concerns"
- Anomaly detection: "This price is suspiciously low - assess supply chain risk"
- Strategy generation: "Recommend this negotiation approach based on vendor profile"
- Context-aware: LLM understands broader business implications

**Result**: 
- Fast preprocessing â†’ Fast LLM-enhanced evaluation â†’ Better decisions
- Explainable decisions: Rules for filtering, LLM for reasoning
- Cost-effective: LLM only used where nuance matters

  - **Formula**: `confidence = distance_factor * 0.6 + lead_time_factor * 0.4`
  - **Distance Factor**: max(0.2, 1.0 - (distance/10000)) â†’ 0.44-1.0 for 0-5600 miles
  - **Scoring**: Delivery track contributes 33% to final score

- [x] **Track 3: Financial Analysis Evaluator** (LLM-Enhanced) âœ…
  - **Class**: `FinancialAnalysisEvaluator` extends `DemoBaseAgent`
  - **Status**: Working - Price anomaly detection and negotiation strategy generation

---

## Phase 6: Human-in-the-Loop (Human Gate) âœ… COMPLETE

Phase 6 introduces a human-in-the-loop step to the RFQ negotiation workflow. After the NegotiationStrategyAgent generates recommendations, the HumanGateAgent pauses the workflow for human review, approval, or edits before finalizing the negotiation strategy.

### 6.1 Architecture âœ…

**Backend Components**:
1. **HumanGateAgent** (`human_gate_agent.py`)
   - Async agent that pauses workflow execution for human input
   - Stores pending requests with status tracking (`pending_request` dict)
   - `request_human_input()`: Returns special message to trigger frontend UI with type "human_gate"
   - `handle_human_action()`: Processes frontend action (approve/edit/reject) and resumes workflow
   - Actions supported: `approve`, `edit`, `reject`
   - Pattern: Non-blocking async/await, no CLI `input()` blocking

2. **Phase6NegotiationOrchestrator** (`phase6_negotiation_orchestrator.py`)
   - Integrates NegotiationStrategyAgent â†’ HumanGateAgent
   - Sequential pipeline: generates recommendation, pauses for approval
   - Returns final approved recommendation or None if rejected
   - Pattern: Async orchestration with proper error handling

3. **API Endpoint** (`/api/human-gate/action`)
   - POST endpoint receives human action from frontend
   - Routes to `HumanGateAgent.handle_human_action(action, data)`
   - Returns processed result to frontend
   - **File**: `backend/src/api/human_gate.py`
   - Registered in `backend/src/api/__init__.py`

**Frontend Components**:
1. **HumanGateActions Component** (`HumanGateActions.tsx`)
   - Renders three buttons: Approve (primary), Edit (secondary), Reject (outline)
   - Calls `apiPost('/api/human-gate/action', { action })` on button click
   - Async handler processes backend response and invokes callback
   - Proper TypeScript typing with error handling

2. **Message Type Extension** (`message.ts`)
   - Added `humanGateActions?: Array<'approve' | 'edit' | 'reject'>` to Message interface
   - Added `humanGateData?: any` for passing context and callbacks
   - Signals MessageBubble to render action buttons when present

3. **MessageBubble Integration** (`MessageBubble.tsx`)
   - Detects `message.humanGateActions` presence in assistant messages
   - Conditionally renders HumanGateActions component below message content
   - Passes action handler that logs results (extensible for state updates)
   - Disabled during streaming to prevent premature actions

### 6.2 Data Flow âœ…

```
1. NegotiationStrategyAgent generates recommendation
2. HumanGateAgent.request_human_input() returns:
   {
     "type": "human_gate",
     "recommendation": <NegotiationRecommendation object>,
     "actions": ["approve", "edit", "reject"]
   }
3. Frontend SSE stream receives message with humanGateActions
4. MessageBubble renders three buttons in chat UI
5. User clicks button â†’ POST /api/human-gate/action with { action: "approve" }
6. Backend HumanGateAgent.handle_human_action() processes action
7. Returns recommendation (approve/edit) or None (reject)
8. Workflow resumes or halts based on action
```

### 6.3 Key Design Decisions âœ…

**âœ… Button-based UI**: Replaced CLI `input()` with frontend buttons for better UX and non-blocking async workflow  
**âœ… Async state management**: Agent stores pending request in `self.pending_request`, waits for frontend action via API  
**âœ… SSE integration**: Human gate trigger flows through existing streaming chat infrastructure  
**âœ… Action types**: 
  - `approve`: Continue workflow with original recommendation
  - `edit`: Modify recommendation (e.g., adjust `suggested_unit_price` via data dict)
  - `reject`: Halt workflow, return None
**âœ… Extensible**: `data` parameter allows frontend to pass edit details (e.g., `{"suggested_unit_price": 100.0}`)  
**âœ… Type safety**: Full TypeScript typing on frontend, Pydantic models on backend

### 6.4 Testing âœ…
- [x] **Unit Test**: `test_phase6_human_gate.py`
  - Mocks `input()` with monkeypatch to simulate approval action
  - Verifies orchestrator flow: NegotiationAgent â†’ HumanGate â†’ Result
  - Asserts recommendation passes through correctly on approval
  - Test passing with proper async/await patterns

### 6.5 Code Locations âœ…
- **Backend Agent**: `backend/src/agents/workflows/rfq/agents/human_gate_agent.py`
- **Backend Orchestrator**: `backend/src/agents/workflows/rfq/agents/phase6_negotiation_orchestrator.py`
- **Backend API**: `backend/src/api/human_gate.py`
- **Frontend Component**: `frontend/src/components/chat/HumanGateActions.tsx`
- **Frontend Types**: `frontend/src/types/message.ts`
- **Frontend Integration**: `frontend/src/components/chat/MessageBubble.tsx`
- **Integration Test**: `backend/test_phase6_human_gate.py`

### 6.6 Reference âœ…
Inspired by: [Microsoft Agent Framework - Human-in-the-Loop Example](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/blob/main/python/samples/getting_started/workflows/human-in-the-loop/guessing_game_with_human_input.py)

### 6.7 Next Steps
- [ ] Full end-to-end RFQ workflow test with human gate integration
- [ ] Edit functionality with form input for price adjustments (currently data dict only)
- [ ] Feedback loop: rejection triggers re-negotiation with modified parameters
- [ ] UI enhancements: display recommendation details before action buttons

## Phase 8: Orchestration Integration

### 8.1 Build Master Orchestrator
- [ ] Create `RFQWorkflowOrchestrator` that chains all stages:
  1. Sequential: Product Review
  2. Sequential: Vendor Qualification
  3. **Parallel**: RFQ Submissions â†’ Response Collection
  4. **Parallel**: 3-track Evaluation (Review, Delivery, Financial)
  5. Sequential: Comparison & Analysis
  6. Sequential: Negotiation Strategy
  7. **Human Gate**: Approval with feedback loop
  8. Sequential: PO Generation
  9. Sequential: PO Distribution

### 8.2 Implement Workflow State Management
- [ ] Store intermediate state at each stage
- [ ] Enable resumption from failure points
- [ ] Track all decisions and reasoning

- [ ] Verify state persistence at each stage

### 9.3 Workflow Tests
- [ ] End-to-end workflow with 2-3 vendors
- [ ] Test human approval gate interactions
- [ ] Test negotiation feedback loop
- [ ] Test error recovery and fallback paths

### 9.4 Performance Tests
- [ ] Measure parallel vs. sequential execution time
- [ ] Track API/database call counts
- [ ] Validate concurrent request handling
- [ ] Stress test with 5+ parallel vendor submissions

---

## Phase 10: Documentation & Demo

### 10.1 Technical Documentation
- [ ] Document workflow architecture and patterns
- [ ] Create agent responsibility matrix
- [ ] Document data flow diagrams
- [ ] Write integration guide for new agents

### 10.2 Demo Preparation
- [ ] Create sample RFQ scenarios:
  - Electronics vendor evaluation (3 vendors)
  - Industrial component procurement (4 vendors)
  - Service procurement (2 vendors)
- [ ] Prepare demo script and talking points
- [ ] Create visual workflow diagrams

### 10.3 User Documentation
- [ ] Document approval gate UI/UX requirements
- [ ] Create decision-maker guide
- [ ] Document supported approval decision types

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Parallelism Strategy
- **Stage 1 (RFQ Submission)**: All vendors receive RFQ concurrently
- **Stage 2 (Evaluation)**: Three parallel evaluation tracks (Review, Delivery, Financial)
- **Merge Strategy**: Consolidate all evaluations into unified vendor scorecard
- **Tooling**: Microsoft Agent Framework `ConcurrentBuilder` with fan-out/fan-in pattern

### Human-in-the-Loop Pattern
- Uses `ctx.request_info()` to pause workflow
- Application captures `RequestInfoEvent` and prompts user
- User decision sent back via `send_responses_streaming()`
- Workflow resumes with decision routed to appropriate next stage
- Supports feedback loops (e.g., re-negotiation)

### Data Persistence
- State checkpointing after each major stage
- All intermediate results stored for audit trail
- Enables recovery from partial failures

### Error Handling Philosophy
- Graceful degradation (missing vendor response â†’ use alternative)
- Explicit user notification for critical failures
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Escalation path to human for policy decisions

---

## Implementation Order (Recommended)

1. **Start with Phase 1-2**: Build data models and sequential foundation
2. **Then Phase 3**: Implement parallel orchestration (core complexity)
3. **Then Phase 4-5**: Add comparison and negotiation logic
4. **Then Phase 6**: Integrate human gate (most user-facing)
5. **Then Phase 7-8**: Complete PO stage and master orchestrator
6. **Finally Phase 9-10**: Test and demo

---

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1-2 (Completed) âœ…
- âœ… All core models defined with Pydantic validation
- âœ… Configuration system with 4 presets (Dev/Test/Prod/Demo)
- âœ… Structured JSON logging and audit trail
- âœ… ProductReviewAgent working (category â†’ certifications/compliance/ratings)
- âœ… VendorQualificationAgent working (vendor database + filtering)
- âœ… PreprocessingOrchestrator working (sequential handoff)
- âœ… Integration test passing (0.11s end-to-end, 3 vendors qualified)

### Phase 3 (Completed) âœ…
- âœ… All three parallel evaluation agents execute concurrently (Compliance, Delivery, Financial)
- âœ… Results from parallel stage merge correctly into unified scorecard
- âœ… 15 concurrent LLM evaluations (5 vendors Ã— 3 tracks) execute successfully
- âœ… Varied scores achieved (2.6-4.0/5.0) based on vendor data differentiation
- âœ… Distance-based delivery confidence calculation active (0.44-1.0 range)
- âœ… Compliance scoring reflects certification count (1-5 certs)
- âœ… Financial analysis detects pricing patterns and anomalies
- âœ… Integration test passing (9.036s parallel evaluation, 0.216s quote parsing)
- âœ… Error handling with graceful fallback (0.5 confidence on LLM failure)
- âœ… Debug logging removed - production-ready code

### Phase 4+ (Pending Implementation)
- [ ] Human approval gate pauses workflow and resumes with decision
- [ ] Re-negotiation feedback loop works without restarting entire workflow
- [ ] End-to-end workflow completes in <2 minutes for 5-vendor scenario
- [ ] All intermediate states persisted for audit trail
- [ ] Comparison report generated with side-by-side vendor analysis
- [ ] Negotiation strategy agent produces talking points per vendor

## Notes & Considerations

### Microsoft Agent Framework Patterns Used
1. **ConcurrentBuilder**: For parallel evaluation tracks (Phase 3.4-3.5)
2. **WorkflowBuilder with fan-out/fan-in edges**: For parallel RFQ submissions
3. **RequestInfoEvent / response_handler**: For human-in-the-loop approval gate (Phase 6)
4. **Sequential handoffs**: For all pre/post parallel stages

### Future Enhancements
- Automated negotiation without human gate (advanced LLM negotiation)
- Machine learning model for vendor scoring refinement
- Integration with real email systems and vendor APIs
- Supplier relationship management (SRM) system integration
- Contract management and PO compliance tracking
- Analytics dashboard for procurement metrics

### Risk Mitigation
- Timeout handling for slow vendor responses (fallback to next vendor)
- Data validation at each transformation step
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Gradual rollout: Simulation mode â†’ Pilot with subset of vendors â†’ Full production
