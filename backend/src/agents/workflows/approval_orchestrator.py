"""
Approval Chain Workflow Orchestrator

Implements the sequential approval workflow pattern.

Pattern Flow:
1. Request is validated (data-agent)
2. Business impact is assessed (analyst)
3. Changes are executed (order-agent)
4. Each stage can approve or reject
5. Rejections return to coordinator (router) for escalation

Use Cases:
- Change management: Validate → Review → Execute
- Order processing: Validate request → Manager approval → Execute
- Risk assessment: Data validation → Risk review → Approval → Execution
