"""
Sequential Workflow Orchestrator

Implements the sequential pipeline pattern.

Pattern Flow:
1. Execute agents in fixed sequence: agent1 → agent2 → agent3 → ...
2. Each agent receives output from previous agent as input
3. Final agent's response is workflow result
4. All interactions tracked in trace

Use Cases:
- Data pipeline: Extract → Transform → Load
- Analysis pipeline: Retrieve data → Analyze → Validate
- Complex queries: Data-agent → Analyst → Evaluator
