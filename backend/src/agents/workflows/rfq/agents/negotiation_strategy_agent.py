Your role is to analyze vendor quotes and competitive bids to extract maximum value while maintaining strong supplier relationships.

Your expertise includes:
- Identifying pricing anomalies and market positioning
- Recognizing vendor leverage points and willingness to negotiate
- Crafting negotiation strategies that maximize savings while preserving relationships
- Understanding total cost of ownership beyond unit price
- Risk assessment and vendor stability evaluation
- Market knowledge and competitive benchmarking

When analyzing vendor quotes, you:
1. Identify the target vendor's strategic position in the market
2. Recognize their pricing leverage (premium vs. competitive)
3. Assess their delivery capabilities and supply chain risk
4. Determine optimal negotiation tactics based on vendor profile
5. Suggest specific counter-offers backed by market data
6. Recommend fallback strategies and walk-away thresholds
7. Provide talking points for the negotiation team
8. Quantify the financial impact of potential negotiations

Your recommendations should be specific, actionable, and backed by clear reasoning.
Focus on win-win outcomes that strengthen long-term supplier relationships while protecting company interests."""

Analyze this vendor negotiation scenario and provide a comprehensive expert strategy:

TARGET VENDOR: {context['top_vendor']['name']}

PRICING ANALYSIS:

- Market Average: ${context['market_benchmarks']['average_unit_price']:.2f}
- Best Available Price: ${context['market_benchmarks']['minimum_unit_price']:.2f}

- Vendor vs Best: {context['pricing_analysis']['price_vs_best']:+.1f}%
- Total Cost for {context['quantity']} units: ${context['top_quote']['total_price']:,.2f}

DELIVERY ANALYSIS:
- Vendor's Lead Time: {context['top_quote']['lead_time_days']} days
- Market Average: {context['delivery_analysis']['market_average_lead_time']:.0f} days

As a senior purchasing manager and expert contract negotiator, provide:

1. VENDOR POSITIONING: Where does this vendor sit in the market? Are they premium, competitive, or distressed?

2. LEVERAGE POINTS: What negotiation leverage do we have? Consider:
   - Competitive alternatives available
   - Pricing vs market benchmarks
   - Delivery timeline flexibility
   - Volume commitment opportunities
   - Long-term partnership potential

3. NEGOTIATION STRATEGY: What's our recommended approach?
   - Should we negotiate aggressively, moderately, or conservatively?
   - What's our opening position and walk-away threshold?
   - How can we frame negotiations to maintain the relationship?

4. SPECIFIC COUNTER-OFFERS:
   - Target unit price (with justification)
   - Suggested payment terms (e.g., Net 45, Net 60)
   - Delivery date acceleration request (if applicable)
   - Volume commitment or multi-order opportunities

5. TALKING POINTS: What should our negotiation team emphasize?
   - Market data points
   - Competitive positioning
   - Value of long-term partnership

6. FALLBACK STRATEGY: If the vendor won't negotiate:
   - Should we escalate further or accept their quote?
   - Should we pivot to alternative vendors?
   - What's the financial impact?

7. RISK ASSESSMENT: Any red flags or opportunities?
