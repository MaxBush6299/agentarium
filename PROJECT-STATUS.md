## 🎯 Decision Points

### What Should We Do Next?

#### Option A: Start Frontend Development (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Can build UI with 2 working agents
- Parallel work on remaining agents
- Faster path to demo-able product
- Frontend doesn't need all agents to start

**Cons:**
- Agent list will be incomplete initially
- May need UI adjustments as agents are added

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 weeks for basic UI

#### Option B: Complete Remaining Agents First
**Pros:**
- Backend fully complete before frontend
- All 5 agents available for frontend testing
- No need to update UI as agents are added

**Cons:**
- Delays frontend work
- Longer time to demo-able product
- Backend complete but not visible

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 weeks for 3 agents

#### Option C: Optional Enhancements
**Tasks:**
- Integrate agent registry with chat API
- Implement OAuth authentication for admin endpoints
- Add agent validation (tool reachability checks)

**Estimated Time:** 3-5 days

---

## 🔧 Technical Debt & Known Issues

### High Priority
1. **OAuth Authentication:** Admin endpoints use placeholder auth
   - Impact: Security risk in production
   - Solution: Implement Azure AD token validation
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 days

2. **Chat API Integration:** Not using agent registry yet
   - Impact: Hardcoded agent mapping instead of dynamic lookup
   - Solution: Update `get_agent()` to query repository
   - Estimated effort: 4-6 hours

### Medium Priority
3. **Agent Creation Tests:** 3 unit tests fail due to Azure dependencies
   - Impact: Lower test coverage percentage
   - Solution: Mock agent creation in unit tests
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 hours

4. **Azure MCP Server:** Known compatibility issues
   - Impact: Limited Azure operations in agents
   - Solution: Work with Azure MCP team or build wrapper
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 days

### Low Priority
5. **Generic Agent Factory:** No dynamic agent creation from metadata
   - Impact: Manual code for each new agent
   - Solution: Build factory that creates agents from AgentMetadata
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 days

6. **Hierarchical Traces:** Not yet implemented for A2A calls
   - Impact: Flat trace display instead of nested
   - Solution: Update trace generation for nested calls
   - Estimated effort: 1 day
